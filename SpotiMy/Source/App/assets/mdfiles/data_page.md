## Our data

The **data** used for this project was generously given to us by **Spotify** after a long process of negotiations and verifications. It contains tons of sensitive information we would not usually share (I mean, who wants to admit they listen to One Direction regularly), so *#nojudgement*.    
By the way, if this work-of-art dashboard inspired you to dig deeper into your streaming history, feel free to [check out this page](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/ ) :)
